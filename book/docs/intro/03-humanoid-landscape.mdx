</div>

<div className="prerequisites">

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:

- **Chapter**: Completed [From Digital to Physical](./02-digital-to-physical)
- **Context**: General awareness of robotics industry news
- **Perspective**: Interest in commercial robotics applications

</div>

## Why Humanoids?

The human form factor offers compelling advantages for general-purpose robotics:

        C3[High DoF]
        C4[Power consumption]
    end
```

### The Environment Argument

Our world is built for humans:
- **Stairs and doors** sized for human bodies
- **Tools** designed for human hands
- **Workspaces** optimized for human reach and height
- **Interfaces** (buttons, handles, levers) for human operation

:::tip Economic Reality
Adapting every factory, warehouse, and home for robots would cost trillions. A robot that adapts to human spaces is far more practical.
